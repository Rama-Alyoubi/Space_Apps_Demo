. Our project, MIRALUX, encompasses two captivating demonstrations that showcase the potential of our idea. The first demonstration features an interactive app that allows users to explore the simulated habitable planets we have generated. This app provides a user-friendly interface where users can navigate and learn more about these virtual worlds, enhancing their understanding of the vast diversity of habitable planets beyond our solar system. By immersing themselves in the app, users can gain a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth.

. The second demonstration is a simple yet powerful AR example. Using AR technologies, we have brought our AI-generated habitable planets to life, allowing users to witness the beauty and intricacies of these simulated worlds in a visually stunning and interactive manner. Through their device's camera, users can see these virtual planets superimposed onto their physical surroundings, creating a sense of awe and wonder. This AR experience bridges the gap between imagination and reality, enabling users to explore and engage with these habitable worlds in ways that were previously unimaginable.
